`localModel` is a successor to the [`live`](https://github.com/MI2DataLab/live) package. It implements a variant of LIME method for explaining single predictions of black box machine learning models for tabular data.
Interpretable features are created based on [Ceteris Paribus](https://github.com/ModelOriented/ceterisParibus2) plots.
Details of the methodology are described in the vignette.

To get started, install the newest version from GitHub by using the code below. 
Please do not use the `devtools` package, since it is affected [a bug](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1900) which makes `localModel` installation impossible.
This issue was solved in the Github version of `remotes`.

```
devtools::install_github("r-lib/remotes")
remotes::install_github("ModelOriented/localModel")
```

To get help, see examples and details of the methodology, please refer to package website and vignettes.
